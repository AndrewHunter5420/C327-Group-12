# C327-Group-12

Project Duration/Timeline: September 2022 to December 2022 (development of this project has concluded and will not be continued).

Context: This was a team project (4 people) for CISC 327 (Software Quality Assurance) at Queen's University. The client's (professor's) requirements for this project can be viewed here: https://github.com/CISC-CMPE-327/Information-2022.git. It should be noted that new requirements were given each sprint, with the only "true" sprint being the last (sprint 6) covering all steps of a sprint cycle, including front and back end development and testing.

Purpose: 
In this project, we recreated a system similar to Airbnb and eBay, following our "client's" (professor's) requirements, and translating them into a functional system. The system consists of a locally hosted database and website for users to interact with, allowing users to create new accounts, login to accounts, post listings (wanting to sell something), and purchase/book others' listings. Furthermore, all listings have other details, like price and listing description, and accounts have details like current balance and email. 

What we learned from this project: 
The main focus of this project was the practices that should be applied when developing software to ensure quality, not the system itself. These practices ranged from rigorous and systematic testing, to practices related to working in a team using GitHub. A full list of practices used can be found below. This project was also my first time working with databases and doing web development, which was a good introduction to these topics. However, it should be noted that my experience in databases and web development has improved considerably since working on this project.

Practices applied to ensure quality:
- Documentation explaining the use of functions, classes, and files was required.
- Multiple different black box and white box systematic testing methods were deployed to create both unit and integration test cases. Both the front and back end of the system was tested.
- Each pull request required documentation describing what had been changed, if the change created any known bugs, and other details.
- Each pull request automatically ran style checks and ensured all test cases passed, otherwise the pull request would not be approved.
- Each pull request had to be reviewed and accepted by at least 2 other members before it could be merged into the main branch.
- We followed the scrum development cycle, each sprint focusing on different functionality and features.
