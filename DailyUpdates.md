2. test_registration has been completed. For test_update-listing, I have completed 2/3 of the required test cases, leaving 1 for Kaz to complete.
3. I had to change how some html files worked so test cases could detect if it was on a specific page, and also add more ids to headers.
4. Touch up on existing code and see if I can refactor it.
