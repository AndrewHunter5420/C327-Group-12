### Kaz
Branched worked on
* test_create_listing
* test_update_listing

Progress so far
* test_create_listing
  * Completed all functionality tests using requirement partitioning, input partitioning, output coverage
  * Created helper functions to avoid semlly code (duplicate/similar code) as well as allow others to refactor theirs
* test_update_listing
  * Complete remaining functionality test of requirement partitioning left by Kanchan
  * Refactored Kanchans previous tests to de-odorize the smell (lol)
  * Created additional test cases for exhaustive output coverage

Difficulties
  * Had to change index to give id for the message displayed in create listing page
  * Had to remove the required range of price when clicking create button for testing purposes
  * Extreme trouble setting up Selenium on system

Next steps
* Resolve merge conflicts when merging into main
* Refactor other's code as it needs a shower (smelly)
